# edengths-quarto - Quarto website and PhD thesis template

## ABOUT

This is a quarto project which uses the Latex2e edengths template which corresponds to the regulations regarding layout of a thesis submitted within the University of Edinburgh. It is **not official**, but conforms as best as possible to the regulation as detailed at:

[The University of Edinburgh Academic Services](http://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/thesis-submission)

Please feel free to alter the template to your own liking, but note that the template is made available under the GNU GPL and must be similarly licensed should you wish to release your modified template.

An example of the compiled template is available [here](https://niximagery.github.io/edengths-quarto/The-inside-of-a-ping-pong-ball.pdf). The website it makes can be seen [here](https://niximagery.github.io/edengths-quarto/).
